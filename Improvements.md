#### The product team has decided that we want to make improvements to this application.

## Questions:

## Right now the data for the posts is coming from a json file. What changes would you have to make to the application if it came from an API? In what type of hook should you use to fetch the data and why? What other considerations would you have to make?



## Part of this application uses the package nanoid to generate keys. What issue would this cause for generating keys in React?
